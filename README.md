# Network-Intrusion-Detection-Analysis-and-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
### The project analyzed the different type of network intrusion on the dataset and used machine learning models to predict the likelihood of attack 
### Tasks Performed on Dataset:
• Preprocessed and cleaned a network intrusion dataset to ensure data integrity. 
• Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends in network intrusions. 
July 2024 
• Implemented and compared multiple machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and 
Decision Tree, to predict network intrusions.
